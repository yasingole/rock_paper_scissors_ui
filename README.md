# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Project Overview

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game. The game allows a human player to compete against the computer by selecting either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game keeps track of the scores and declares the winner when either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.

## Project Description

The game is built using HTML and JavaScript. The player interacts with the game by clicking one of the three buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). The computer then randomly selects its choice, and the result of the round is displayed on the screen. The first to reach 5 points wins the game.

## Features

- **Player vs. Computer:** The player competes against the computer, which makes random choices.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the scores for both the player and the computer.
- **Winner Declaration:** The game announces the winner when either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.
- **Automatic Reset:** After a winner is declared, the game resets automatically for a new round.
